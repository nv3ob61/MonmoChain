# MonmoChain
First blockchain implementation, added messages to blocks... Cloned repo from: https://github.com/CryptoKass/NoobChain-Tutorial-Part-2

Loads of things to do:
- Limit transactions per block.
- Implement return false issues.
- Implement a menu: Check blockchain, add transactions.
- GUI implementation.
